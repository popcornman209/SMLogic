# SMLogic
python library for generating scrap mechanic logic contraptions

blank for now, still working on the project. if this isnt gone in a few weeks i got bored of it lol.

update: its mostly done besides the simulator, which is gpu accelerated and made in rust, but i gotta get better at rust before making it usable. right now its half chatgpt have copy pasted bs that isnt useful for really anything.

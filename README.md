# SMLogic
python library for generating scrap mechanic logic contraptions

blank for now, still working on the project.

update: gave up on simulator for now, even using rust+opencl for gpu acceleration it was still slower than just in game with mt fast logic mod. 

todo list: more positioning functions, and maybe a simulator thats actually fast or atleast more useful than in game debugging.
